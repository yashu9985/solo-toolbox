This Privacy Policy describes how Solo Toolbox (the "Site") handles information when you use our web-based tools.

1. Data Collection

1.1 Information Collected by Tools (Zero-Backend)

The core function of Solo Toolbox is to provide utility tools (like the JSON Formatter, Image Optimizer, and Password Generator) that run entirely within your web browser.

No Personal Data Storage: We do not collect, process, or store any personal data, files, text, or results generated by you using our tools on our servers. Your data stays on your computer.

Security: This "zero-backend" approach ensures that your data is safe and private.

1.2 Information Collected by Third Parties (Google AdSense)

The Site uses Google AdSense to display advertisements. Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to this website or other websites.

DoubleClick DART Cookie: Google's use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to users based on their visit to your Site and/or other sites on the Internet.

Opt-Out: Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network Privacy Policy.

1.3 Usage Data (Google Analytics)

We may use Google Analytics or similar services to monitor and analyze the use of our Site. This data is non-personal and includes information such as your browser type, operating system, and the pages you visit. This helps us understand how the tools are being used and where to improve.

2. Links to Other Sites

Our Site may contain links to other websites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.
